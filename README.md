# ARON: Accessible Radiometers for the Oceanographic Nomad

Includes...

Arduino code for an open source beam transmissometer and radiometer, made out of PVC tubes.

Arduino code for a downwelling irradiance sensor and a 3 radiometer complex that measures downwelling irradiance (sunlight), diffuse skylight radiance, and water-leaving radiance (MySAS). 

Arduino code for 3 radiometer complex (downwelling irradiance, diffuse skylight radiance, upwelling radiance) for ESP32 and 3 MKR0's runnign the Hammamatsu C12880ma. MKR code is using GroupGets breakout board for the hammamtsu.
