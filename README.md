# Open Source Oceanography

Includes...

OCEAN-EYE: Oregon Coastal Environments Autonomous Network for Ecosystem Yield Evaluation

- Arduino code for 3 radiometer complex (downwelling irradiance, diffuse skylight radiance, upwelling radiance) for ESP32 and 3 MKR0's running the Hammamatsu C12880ma. MKR code is using GroupGets breakout board for the hammamtsu. 

MySAS: My Spectral Acquisition Sensor (name courtesy of Olivia Cronin-Golomb)

- Arduino code for a multispectral 3 radiometer complex that measures downwelling irradiance (sunlight), diffuse skylight radiance, and water-leaving radiance running the AS7341. 

ARON: Accessible Radiometers for the Oceanographic Nomad

- Arduino code for a downwelling irradiance sensor


Arduino code for an open source beam transmissometer and radiometer, made out of PVC tubes.
